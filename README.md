# daniela-portfolio
## Description
In this project I built a portfolio using HTML and CSS. 
My main goals were 
- To make it responsive, if resized.
- To make the first application's image larger in size than the others when viewed on a pc but same size when viewed on mobile device.
- When the links in the navigation are clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.
- The contact section to take user to the corresponding contact method.
